# RS3Rando v0.1.0

RS3Rando is a (Currently very WIP) randomizer for the Super Famicom title "Romancing SaGa 3."

## Supports the following

* Shuffle or Randomize personal stats

Randomizing stats supports a minimum stat value, a maximum, a BST to aim for, and a variance from the BST the randomizer is allowed to stray off.

* Randomize Proficiency Growths

Randomize the rate a character's weapon type proficiency will grow.

* ROM copy and Changelog!

Writes the changed stats to a separate ROM file of the user's choosing and to a .txt changelog next to the output ROM. Yay for preserving the original ROM file!

### More to be added in later versions!

## TODO

Add support for more options, such as:
* Weapon Specialty and Star Sign randomization
* Changing the modifiers applied by Weapon Specialty and Star Sign
* Proficiency Base Randomization/Shuffle
* Technique Discount Bonus
* Chest Randomization
* Possibly more, depending on my understanding of Romancing SaGa 3
